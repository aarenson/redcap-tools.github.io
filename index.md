[REDCap-Tools](https://github.com/redcap-tools) is an organization to foster interesting projects built against [REDCap](http://project-redcap.org). Developers and projects in this organization have no official ties to REDCap other than looking to push the data management capabilities provided by REDCap's more advanced tools (namely the API and Data Entry Triggers) to their fullest potential. We hope to foster projects across a wide-range of programming languages.

If you have written a tool or application that helped improve reproducibility or accuracy in your a REDCap-based project, please consider housing it in this organization. This growing community of advanced REDCap end-users may find interest in your project and may want to help make it better. Also, if you move on in your career, placing your project under this organization will help to keep it growing and improving after you have moved on.

Notably REDCap-Tools takes no ownership over the projects hosted in this organization. That is left to the discretion of the author(s).
