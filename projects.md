Below you'll find interesting projects built against either REDCap's API, the Data Entry Trigger or some combination.

#### PyCap
* Author: [@sburns](https://github.com/sburns)
* [Docs](http://pycap.readthedocs.org)
* [Source](http://github.com/sburns/PyCap)
* Language: Python

PyCap is a minimal wrapper around the REDCap API to export & import data and files. It natively works with [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org). Install with `pip install PyCap`.

Also a few other libraries exist for communicating with REDCap:

| Project | Language |
| :------ | :------- |
| [GoCap](https://github.com/tjrivera/go-cap) | golang |
| [PhpCap](https://github.com/aarenson/PhpCap) | PHP |
| [PyCap](https://github.com/redcap-tools/PyCap) | Python |
| [redcapAPI](https://github.com/nutterb/redcapAPI) | R |
| [RedcapAPI](https://github.com/eugyev/RedcapAPI) | Ruby |
| [REDCap_API](https://github.com/james2012/REDCap_API) | JavaScript |
| [REDCapR](https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/REDCapR) | R |

(When you're choosing a library, consider if you need one that's been updated since REDCap's version 6.0.0 changes in Sept 2014).
