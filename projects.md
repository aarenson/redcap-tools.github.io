Below you'll find interesting projects built against either [REDCap](http://www.project-redcap.org/)'s API, the Data Entry Trigger or some combination.

Also a few other libraries exist for communicating with REDCap:

| Project | Language<br/>(Documentation) | Description from its Repository|
| :------ | :------: | :----------------------------- |
| [GoCap](https://github.com/tjrivera/go-cap) | Go | A golang based library for REDCap. It provides helpful abstractions for making requests to REDCap's REST API. The project is currently in development and not considered production-ready. |
| [PhpCap](https://github.com/aarenson/PhpCap) | PHP<br/>[(Documentation)](https://github.com/aarenson/PhpCap/blob/master/README.md) | Provides classes that simplify the use of the REDCap application programming interface (API) using PHP. |
| [PyCap](https://github.com/redcap-tools/PyCap) | Python<br/>[(Documentation)](http://pycap.readthedocs.org) | A minimal wrapper around the REDCap API to export & import data and files. It natively works with [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org). |
| [redcapAPI](https://github.com/nutterb/redcapAPI) | R<br/>[(Documentation)](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/redcapAPI/redcapAPI.pdf) | An R interface to REDCap, and is an actively developed fork of [redcap](https://github.com/vubiostat/redcap), originally created by [Jeffrey Horner](https://github.com/jeffreyhorner). |
| [RedcapAPI](https://github.com/eugyev/RedcapAPI) | Ruby | An interface for REDCAP using ruby. |
| [REDCap_API](https://github.com/james2012/REDCap_API) | JavaScript | To Access REDCap by API. |
| [REDCapR](https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/REDCapR) | R<br/>[(Documentation)](https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/REDCapR/blob/master/documentation_peek.pdf) | Encapsulates functions to streamline calls from R to the REDCap API. |

When you're choosing a library, consider if you need one that's been updated since REDCap's version 6.0.0 changes in Sept 2014.
